# ZOOM POLLER

## Overview

This application allows anyone with a Zoom Pro Account to asynchronously create polls for scheduled zoom meetings using the Zoom API. This funcitonality will be useful for those within educational contexts to get a better understanding of what needs to be taught on a certain day, or to get a better understanding of what concepts the students understood from a lesson (exit tickets). Those conducting UX research will also find this application useful, easily polling all participants of a Zoom interview.

The application is still in development. Below is a rough sketch of the roadmap going forward

The backend of this application can be found at https://github.com/jls-github/zoom-polling-app.

### To MVP
